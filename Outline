Have I gone mad?: A developor's guide to project management

Know your team
	Their interests
	Their strengths
	Areas of improvement

Know your client
	What is their service/product
	Who is their audience
	What are their goals/what do they want to accomplish (with this project)
	Who makes the decisions (for the project)
	What is their timeline for the project? 
	Are they available to be involved, or are they too busy?

Keep track of requirements (including changes and the reasons for them)
	What is needed for the project to go live?
	What would be nice to have done when the project goes live, but isn't required?
	What is already in mind for future rounds of development?

Document expectations
	Creating "living" documents, which should be updated as processes and expectations change.
	These documents are nice to reference, as the workflows may be new or changing.
	Everyone should know where these documents are.

Tasks
	Tasks should be actionable, clear, well-documented
	Meet with the dev team on a regular basis to review work done to date and set priorities for the next interval.
		It is helpful to have tasks selected for the sprint before this meeting.
		It is also nice to let the developers choose what they work on (to match their interests) when possible.
		Occassionally assign tasks so that other developers learn how to do something.
